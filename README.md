# Personalised-PageRank
This is a project based on @xinbowu2's achievement of P-PageRank. Because there aren't any annotations in his codes, which makes it hard to understand, I read up them and added detailed annotations among the codes.

I didn't put the DBLP data in this repository beacuse of the size. They should be place in /data dictionary. And a APVPA.txt file is needed, which explained in the codes.

To learn about the P-PageRank, you can read the paper:http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/750/1/2003-29.pdf, "Topic-Sensitive PageRank:
A Context-Sensitive Ranking Algorithm for Web Search"
